## 763. Partition Labels (Medium 6106 245)

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/

You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.
Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"

Output: [9,7,8]

Explanation: The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij". This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"

Output: [10]

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

## 136. Single Number (Easy 8224 285)

https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/ 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 _ 104
-3 _ 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 \* 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## 35. Search Insert Position (Easy 6362 365)

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.

## 46. Permutations (Medium 8718 168)

https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/

Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 6
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
All the integers of nums are unique.
